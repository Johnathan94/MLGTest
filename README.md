# MLGTest

Steps:

1- just clone the project

2- Edit the connection string to a connected sql server in your enviroment

3- start the application from visual studio or you can host in on IIS 

4- Make sure that SqlServer has no database using the same name ("MLGTestDB")

5- the application will create the database ("MLGTestDB") and seed some test data into the database automatically during the first run


You will find some anchors on the main navigation bar that routes you to diffrent actions 


also there is some custom routes as the following 


1- /GetEmoloyeesList  this will return json for all employees without pagination

2- /GetEngineersList  this will return json result for all employees that are asigned to the Engineering department


You can contact me back on the follwoing channels if you found any troubles running the test app
